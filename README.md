A guide to help 100% Kingdom Hearts games.

Right now, this only contains 2 pages for Birth By Sleep. A Melding Guide and Command Collection. My friend and I have been working
through the games to 100% them as we wait for Kingdom Hearts 3. We noticed, as many have, that there was no intiuitive way to search the
melding guides out there so I made one with ionic and angular. In the Command Melding, you are able to search through the commands by
name, ability it gives, or character.  The Command Collection page is just like the one in Birth By Sleep. It is very difficult to know 
what commands are where without a lot of researching, so I ordered them in the same order they are in game. You can select it and then
clicking on the selection will toggle it indicating that you have it or not.

Set up: The easiest way to use this is by using the Chrome Web Server plugin. Download the "www" folder and then choose that folder and
access it by the local url it gives you.

I plan to add more in the future, as I play through the games. I will be definitely be adding a synthesis guide for 1 and 2. I'm open to suggestions and feedback. Hope you enjoy!
